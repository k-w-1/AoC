    "\"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!\" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the [Ceres monitoring station](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10)!\n",
    "\n",
    "As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her _word search_ (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: `XMAS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` - you need to find _all of them_. Here are a few ways `XMAS` might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.`:\n",

    ".A..A.\n",
    "XMAS.S\n",
    ".X....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MMMSXXMASM\n",

    "MXMXAXMASX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this word search, `XMAS` occurs a total of `_18_` times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any `XMAS` have been replaced with `.`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "....XXMAS.\n",
    ".SAMXMS...\n",
    "...S..A...\n",
