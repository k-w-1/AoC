    "This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` - you need to find _all of them_. Here are a few ways `XMAS` might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.`:\n",
