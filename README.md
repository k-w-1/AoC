Personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) repo.

Perhaps some useful nuggets of code to be found, but be warned: AoC gives points based on speed of response; I'm sure there is some nice chart showing the perfect balance between the time of clean, well-written code and the quickly-written-code-vomit that shouldn't work but does :)
