    "# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "You continue following signs for \"Hot Springs\" and eventually come across an [observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory). The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.\n",
    "\n",
    "He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant _image_ (your puzzle input). The image includes _empty space_ (`.`) and _galaxies_ (`#`). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...#......\n",
    ".......#..\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "..........\n",
    "......#...\n",
    ".#........\n",
    ".........#\n",
    "..........\n",
    ".......#..\n",
    "#...#.....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the _shortest path between every pair of galaxies_. However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to something involving gravitational effects, _only some space expands_. In fact, the result is that _any rows or columns that contain no galaxies_ should all actually be twice as big.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   v  v  v\n",
    " ...#......\n",
    " .......#..\n",
    " #.........\n",
    ">..........<\n",
    " ......#...\n",
    " .#........\n",
    " .........#\n",
    ">..........<\n",
    " .......#..\n",
    " #...#.....\n",
    "   ^  ^  ^\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These rows and columns need to be _twice as big_; the result of cosmic expansion therefore looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "....#........\n",
    ".........#...\n",
    "#............\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".............\n",
    "........#....\n",
    ".#...........\n",
    "............#\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".........#...\n",
    "#....#.......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of galaxies can be found. It can help to assign every galaxy a unique number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "....1........\n",
    ".........2...\n",
    "3............\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".............\n",
    "........4....\n",
    ".5...........\n",
    "............6\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".........7...\n",
    "8....9.......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these 9 galaxies, there are _36 pairs_. Only count each pair once; order within the pair doesn't matter. For each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one `.` or `#` at a time. (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is one of the shortest paths between galaxies `5` and `9`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "....1........\n",
    ".........2...\n",
    "3............\n",
    ".............\n",
    ".............\n",
    "........4....\n",
    ".5...........\n",
    ".##.........6\n",
    "..##.........\n",
    "...##........\n",
    "....##...7...\n",
    "8....9.......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This path has length `_9_` because it takes a minimum of _nine steps_ to get from galaxy `5` to galaxy `9` (the eight locations marked `#` plus the step onto galaxy `9` itself). Here are some other example shortest path lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Between galaxy `1` and galaxy `7`: 15\n",
    "- Between galaxy `3` and galaxy `6`: 17\n",
    "- Between galaxy `8` and galaxy `9`: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path between all 36 pairs of galaxies is `_374_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. _What is the sum of these lengths?_"
